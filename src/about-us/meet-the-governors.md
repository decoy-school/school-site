    bio:
      I’m Gill Quantrell, I was a teacher for 27 years and worked in a variety of
      primary schools across all age ranges. My last teaching post was at Decoy
      Primary where I worked as a class teacher and the EYFS lead from
      2007-2019. I now work as a Curriculum Developer and Early Years Consultant
      for Cornerstones Education. I joined the governing board in December 2019,
      so I can continue to support the school community that is so special to
      me.

    bio:
      I started primary teaching in 1999 and left my last school in July 2019.
      During that time, I have led many areas of curriculum, including maths,
      music, PSHE and the humanities, and taught in all year groups. I have also
      been a school SENDCO, and my last post was as Head of School in a small
      federation. Alongside teaching in the school, I have also worked with the
      Devon maths team as a lead maths teacher and have trained and worked as a
      Primary Mastery Specialist leading work groups to develop teachers'
      subject and pedagogical understanding of teaching for mastery in
      mathematics. One of my current roles is as part of the Jurassic Maths Hub
      primary leadership team covering much of Devon and Dorset, visiting
      schools and supporting maths development. I have a strong belief in
      allowing children access to an equitable classroom, where they all play a
      part.

      My careers work at the University of Exeter involves helping people to
      realise their own career dreams and achieve happiness and fulfilment in
      their working lives which is an exciting brief. Sometimes this involves
      working with people who are still choosing their career, and at others,
      helping people in established careers to find new opportunities or
      challenges. I’m therefore proud to chair the Business Management Committee
      at Decoy and hope to be able to support staff in their development at the
      school. 


      I’m a qualified careers advisor, coach, mentor and marketer and I'm happiest when I'm supporting people to succeed. At the school I help to support the development of physical education and some communications work, including supporting the development of the website. 


      I’m very keen that Decoy communicates well with parents and have been pleased to see this improve during my time as governor.

    bio:
      My name is Ruth Dennis and I am delighted to have joined the Governing Body
      from the start of this academic year (September 2020). My affinity with
      the school goes back to the time when my own 3 children received a
      fantastic education here between 1995 to 2005. During part of this time, I
      also worked at the school (1998 – 2003) initially as a Meal Time Assistant
      but then as a Teaching Assistant supporting various class teachers from
      within the First Steps Nursery through to Year 6. I have many fond
      memories of this interesting time which also supported me to progress my
      own career within Education. I left Decoy school in 2003 to commence a
      teaching role but have always kept an interest in the school’s progress
      and journey as I live in the local community. I now look forward to
      supporting in a different capacity and bringing the education and
      managerial skills and experience that I have developed over the years to
      the role of a Governor.

    bio:
      Born in Cornwall, and educated at the local Girls Grammar School, I began
      work at a high street bank. Having met my future husband at school, we
      married in 1978 and in 1981 moved to Dorset, following his transfer within
      the same bank. We lived and worked there for nine years, and had our first
      two children, our youngest son being born in Torbay in 1990 following
      another bank move to Teignmouth. During this time, I had begun studying
      with the Open University, finally completing my degree in 1998, whilst
      continuing to work in the bank. In 1999 I was accepted by St Luke’s in
      Exeter to do my PGCE training, fulfilling a long held ambition to be a
      teacher, and qualifying the following year. After a period of short term
      supply contracts, I arrived at Decoy in May 2001 for a maternity cover in
      Year 3, followed by a permanent appointment in Year 5 in September of the
      same year, and I resolved never to leave. It has been a real privilege to
      be part of such an amazing school community - as class teacher, including
      a period as part of the Senior Leadership Team, and now as Governor.

      I serve on the Learning and Wellbeing committee and my special interest is
      in how we help disadvantaged children and the library. 


      I was originally appointed as a parent governor. When my term of office expired I was co-opted by the governing board. 


      My background is in law and local government.

      I have been the Local Authority Governor at Decoy School for the past
      eleven years and am currently Chair of the Learning and Wellbeing
      Committee. I hold degrees in the biological sciences and a PGCE. 


      During a long career with the BBC, I worked as a technician on a wide range of programme output, as a line manager and finally lecturer in film and video. 


      I put my teacher training to good use when I moved to Devon and was fortunate enough to work as a Lecturer at South Devon College for a number of years. My wife was a teacher and my family also work in the education sector. 


      The Decoy School community is wonderful, it has a dedicated staff and leadership team, supportive parents and talented children who love their school and want to learn. Our aim as governors is to work with the Head and other members of staff to fulfill Decoy School’s aims and values. It has been a real privilege to serve here as one of your governors.

      I am a new Parent Governor at Decoy Primary School, since the beginning of
      2021. My daughter started in Reception September 2020, and I wanted to
      help the school to be the best it can, and support our children to achieve
      their full potential. I hope to support the school to create an
      environment where each child develops confidence, can excel creatively,
      socially and academically and where each child feels valued. 


      I feel very fortunate in the education opportunities that I have had which have encouraged me to pursue a career in medicine and an interest in music. As a Doctor, I am familiar with reviewing and appraising things and supporting people and hope to utilise these skills in supporting the fellow governors as much as I am able. My job entails continually updating my knowledge and skills and so does being part of the Business Management Committee, a challenging but worthwhile experience. Outside of these roles I am a top chef, expert photographer, dancing diva, singer, talented musician, rambler, parrot whisperer, a ‘les mills’ expert – to my family and friends anyway!!!! Growing up I enjoyed playing in orchestras, singing in bands, dancing in shows and breeding parrots. Now all grown up with children, I mostly enjoy spending time with them when I have time to escape and enjoy exercise for some light relief! Since Covid I have taken more of an interest in cooking more healthily and capturing memorable moments with photography. 


      I hope my enthusiasm and passion for life in general, will be a positive influence for my role as a governor.

      years having spent the last four years as Headteacher at Decoy Primary
      School. 


      I am fortunate to work with such a dedicated and talented Governing Board who are committed to the very best outcomes for our children and feel privileged to spend every day with the wonderful children at fantastic staff team at Decoy.

    bio: I joined Decoy Primary in September 2018 as a KS2 class teacher and PE
      subject leader. From September 2021 I took on English subject leadership
      and am really enjoying this new role. This is the first time that I have
      been a governors and I sit on the Business Management Committee which
      helps to give me a good understanding of a different side of school life –
      outside of the classroom.

      I am a recently appointed Parent Governor at Decoy Primary School having
      joined in October 2021. My daughter, niece and nephew all attend the
      school, as did my wife and her brother some 30 years ago! 


      With a career background in local government and most recently as a Town Clerk I am all too aware of the pressures faced by public sector organisations which can have such a big impact on all those who work in them, and not least those who stand to benefit the most from them – our kids! In the short time I’ve been a Governor I have developed a newfound respect for all school staff with the volume of benchmarking, analysing, planning, and delivering they have to do, not to mention the sheer knowledge they have to possess – it certainly has reassured me as a parent that our children are benefitting from great teaching at Decoy and I certainly hope I can do my bit to help ensure that continues in the years to come.
