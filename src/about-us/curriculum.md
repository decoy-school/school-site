From September 2014 a new National Curriculum has been introduced in England with new programmes of study and attainment targets.

## Why the big curriculum change?

The main aim is to raise standards. The new curriculum has been developed partly by comparing England’s curriculum to those in other countries. As the Department of Education puts it, it’s all about trying to compete in the global economy and the forthcoming curriculum “combines the best elements of what is taught in the world’s most successful school systems, including Hong Kong, Massachusetts, Singapore and Finland, with some of the most impressive \[existing] practice from schools in England.”

Although the new curriculum is intended to be more challenging, the content is actually slimmer than the current curriculum, focusing on essential core subject knowledge and skills such as essay writing and computer programming.

In order to prepare pupils for the more ambitious end of year expectations in English, Mathematics and Science, as set out in the new curriculum, teachers at Decoy have amended their delivery of the programmes of study detailed above as appropriate. New programmes of study for English and Mathematics have been adopted in full from September 2014, in line with guidance from the Department of Education and our creative curriculum has been fully updated to account for these changes. New maths resources are being invested in, and a new English programme has been adopted from September to take account of these changes.

## Phonics and Reading Schemes

We use a variety of resources to support our youngest children to develop thier phonic and early reading skills.

These include:
**Jolly Phonics, Letters & Sounds, Big Cat Phonic Books, Ruth Miskin Phonic Books, Songbirds Phonic Readers** and **Dandelion Readers.**

We use a wide variety of reading schemes but make sure that the first books we introduce to the children are phonically decodable.

## Year Group Curricula

These links are currently being updated, and will give details of the curriculum followed in each year group.
