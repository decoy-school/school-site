**Curriculum Intent** (currently under review): All children learn, practice, develop and refine a wide range of skills in their work across the curriculum. Every child's ability is recognised, developed and rewarded with our curriculum tailored to meet individual needs and aspirations. We have high expectations and a strong focus on literacy and numeracy across the curriculum.

We promote enjoyment for learning and encourage children to work independently, with partners and in groups helping them embed social skills though collaboration and cooperation. To meet each child's individual needs, we provide extra support, enrichment and new challenges to help every child fulfil their potential.

Pupil engagement is key to pupil success and we plan relevant, enjoyable and interesting experiences to broaden thinking and develop a love of lifelong learning. All children access a wide range of extra-curricular activities - we welcome visitors, plan exciting trips off site and organise residential stays to France and the Isle of Wight to support learning and enthuse and inspire.

Alongside the statutory National Curriculum, PSHE and RE, our curriculum also includes the 'hidden curriculum'. We aim to teach children how to grow into positive, responsible people, who can work and co-operate with others while developing knowledge and skills and crucially achieve all that they can.

The links below outline the curriculum during the academic year for each year group and the termly overviews.

## Phonics and Reading Schemes

We use a variety of resources to support our youngest children to develop their phonic and early reading skills.
These include: **Jolly Phonics**, **Letters & Sounds**, **Big Cat Phonic Books**, **Ruth Miskin Phonic Books**, **Songbirds Phonic Readers** and **Dandelion Readers**.
We use a wide variety of reading schemes but make sure that the first books we introduce to the children are phonically decodable.
Letters and Sounds is a phonics resource published by the Department for Education and Skills in 2007. It aims to build children's speaking and listening skills in their own right as well as to prepare children for learning to read by developing their phonic knowledge and skills. It sets out a detailed and systematic programme for teaching phonic skills for children starting by the age of five, with the aim of them becoming fluent readers by age seven.
The programme develops through six phases, with children learning new phonic skills in a well-resourced environment. All our teachers and teaching assistants are trained in the delivery of Letters and Sounds and so we are able to run a number of small, ability-based groups.
We use Jolly Phonics to support childrenâ€™s learning of phonics. Jolly Phonics is a fun and child centred approach to teaching literacy through synthetic phonics. With actions for each of the sounds, the multi-sensory method is very motivating for children and teachers, who can see their students achieve.
We also run parent workshops to enable parents to better support their children in learning phonics.

| **Phase**                                  | **Phonic Knowledge and Skills**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Phase One_ (Nursery/Reception)            | Activities are divided into seven aspects, including environmental sounds, instrumental sounds, body sounds, rhythm and rhyme, alliteration, voice sounds and finally oral blending and segmenting.                                                                                                                                           |
| _Phase Two_ (Reception) up to 6 weeks      | Learning 19 letters of the alphabet and one sound for each. Blending sounds together to make words. Segmenting words into their separate sounds. Beginning to read simple captions.                                                                                                                                                           |
| _Phase Three_ (Reception) up to 12 weeks   | The remaining 7 letters of the alphabet, one sound for each. Graphemes such as ch, oo, th representing the remaining phonemes not covered by single letters. Reading captions, sentences and questions. On completion of this phase, children will have learnt the "simple code", i.e. one grapheme for each phoneme in the English language. |
| _Phase Four_ (Reception) 4 to 6 weeks      | No new grapheme-phoneme correspondences are taught in this phase. Children learn to blend and segment longer words with adjacent consonants, e.g. swim, clap, jump.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| _Phase Five_ (Throughout Year 1)           | Now we move on to the "complex code". Children learn more graphemes for the phonemes which they already know, plus different ways of pronouncing the graphemes they already know                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Phase Six_ (Throughout Year 2 and beyond) | Working on spelling, including prefixes and suffixes, doubling and dropping letters, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Early Reading

Teaching of phonics is integral to the teaching of reading and although a major part, it is not the only thing we do. We have a range of reading books from which the children can choose. These are organised into colour bands, through which children progress as their phonic and comprehension skills develop. In addition to Letters and Sounds sessions, the children are taught by their teacher in what are called "guided reading" groups where teachers teach and assess children's reading skills. Children are also free to borrow books from our school library.
