Decoy Community Primary is an inclusive school and we work with a range of agencies and professionals to meet the needs of **all pupils** including those with a Special Educational Need and/or Disability.\
\
Pupils with a Special Educational Need/s and or Disabilities will take part in learning and activities with pupils without a Special Educational Need/s and or Disabilities whenever possible. As a mainstream school, Decoy Primary is supported by by Devon Local Authority and Torbay to ensure that **all pupils** make the best possible progress in school.\
\
Your child’s class teacher will contact you if they consider your child may have special educational needs. However, please do not hesitate to contact the class teacher or SEND co-ordinator, Mrs Vicky Stables by emailing vstables@decoyschool.co.uk, if you wish to discuss any matters relating to SEND.

By working together we can achieve the best outcomes for all our pupils.
