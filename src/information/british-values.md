title: British Values

<!--StartFragment-->

All school are required to promote children’s social, moral, cultural, mental and physical development. As part of our school ethos and through the broader curriculum we aim to develop children’s spiritually, morally, socially, and culturally. We teach this into the teaching of fundamental British values.\
\
 *“Schools should promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. This can help schools to demonstrate how they are meeting the requirements of section 78 of the Education Act2002, in their provision of SMSC.*​\
\
*Actively promoting the values means challenging opinions or behaviours in school that are contrary to fundamental British values. Attempts to promote systems that undermine fundamental British values would be completely at odds with schools’ duty to provide SMSC. The Teachers’ Standards expect teachers to uphold public trust in the profession and maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour, within and outside school. This includes not undermining fundamental British values.”  - Promoting Fundamental British values as part of SMSC in schools (DfE, 2014)*\
