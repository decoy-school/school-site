Here at Decoy, we run Breakfast & After School Clubs every day of the academic year.

Our setting is run on the school site in the Community Room; this location gives us the ability to have large outdoor space and access to the school field when the weather is kind. We run regular adult led activities ranging from arty tasks to cooking. The children have free access to toys, games and art resources during each session, along with Nintendo Dsi consoles and a Nintendo Wii - so there's something for everyone!

Children in our First Steps Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 classes are taken to class after Breakfast Club, or collected from class for After School Club by a member of the team.

## Breakfast Club

**Our Breakfast Club runs 7:55am - 8:55am.**

All the children have the option of a variety of breakfast choices ranging from cereals, toast, scrambled eggs and other hot items perfect for those cold wintery mornings; and just as popular in the summer term too!

The children can choose from a range of drinks including fruit juices, milk and other cold drinks. We offer a 'share platter' every morning consisting of Fruit Toast, Crumpets, Golden Pancakes; along with fresh fruit.

## After School Club

**Our After School Club runs 3:30pm - 6:00pm.**

Parents and carers also have the option to book only until 5:00pm. All children have the option of a variety of snacks including beans on toast, scrambled eggs, pizzas, pasta, toast, wraps and hotdogs. Fresh fruit, salad and drinks are provided throughout the sessions.

## Additional Information

Choosing the correct childcare is crucial, and we offer group care to children from Nursery up to Year 6. This may not be everyone’s choice, and therefore we provide information on other types of childcare through the Devon County Council’s Family Information Service **(DISC)**. There are several local child-minders who drop off and collect from Decoy; details can be found by going to the [Devon Family Information Directory](http://devon.childrensservicedirectory.org.uk/kb5/devon/disc/home.page).

All of our bread products are kindly supplied by Warburtons.
