## Intent

At Decoy Community Primary School, Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE) enables our children to become healthy, independent and responsible members of a society. We endeavour to foster a culture of high self-worth and self-respect helping children to make choices that keep them safe and well. It aims to help them understand how they are developing personally and socially, and tackles many of the moral, social and cultural issues that are part of growing up. We provide our children with opportunities for them to learn about rights and responsibilities and appreciate what it means to be a member of a diverse society. Our children are encouraged to develop their sense of self-worth by playing a positive role in contributing to school life and the wider community.

We deliver the PSHE curriculum by utilising first hand experience and sharing good practice. However, we are aware that the delivered curriculum must reflect the needs of our pupils. Our teachers follow the Jigsaw PSHE programme to equip pupils with a sound understanding of risk and with the knowledge and skills necessary to make safe and informed decisions. 

Decoy Community Primary School believes that PSHE plays a vital part of primary education. This enables staff to ensure full coverage of PSHE and RSE is taught in their year group. There are always occasions where teachers may feel it necessary to teach PSHE as a result of an issue arisen in their own class. PSHE is integral to the development of children values in order for them to become a positive citizen in a forever changing community. PSHE is an important part of school assemblies.
