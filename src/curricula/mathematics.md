## Aims

**The national curriculum for mathematics aims to ensure that all pupils:**

•	become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics, including through varied and frequent practice with increasingly complex problems over time, so that pupils develop conceptual understanding and the ability to recall and apply knowledge rapidly and accurately

•	reason mathematically by following a line of enquiry, conjecturing relationships and generalisations, and developing an argument, justification or proof using mathematical language

•	can solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions

*Curriculum Intent*

At Decoy, we aim for all of our pupils to become fluent in the fundamentals of Mathematics, being able to reason and solve problems. Mathematics is a highly interconnected subject and through our daily maths lessons, we want our pupils to understand the structure of number, make connections between different representations, use mathematical language to discuss what they are doing and to be curious to ask questions and want to find out more.

We promote resilience, adaptability and an understanding that ‘struggle’ is often a necessary part of learning and that mistakes are important learning opportunities. We aim that our pupils can relate maths to everyday contexts so that they see it as an integral part of daily life; a universal language used to predict and represent events and solve everyday problems. We endeavour to ensure an enjoyment and enthusiasm for learning and using maths that our pupils will carry through life.

 

*Curriculum Implementation*

At Decoy, we follow the structure and sequence of White Rose Maths (WRM). Teachers will use and adapt the teaching resources to suit the needs of their pupils. Each sequence will start with an elicitation task to establish pupils’ prior knowledge and end with an assessment to measure progress. Lessons begin with a short fluency practice. Alongside WRM, we use SPARX in KS2, an online platform to develop times table recall, and other resources such as NRICH to develop problem solving and reasoning skills.

In Nursery and Reception, maths is built into our daily routines so that the children have time to practise and embed the skills they need. For example, we use register maths every day to develop different skills and we count/compare our book vote each day to find out which story we will read. We encourage and support children to develop number and shape, space and measure throughout the day by using continuous or enhanced provision resources independently to consolidate what they have learnt. We also use adults as the resource to extend the children’s knowledge, skills and thinking or to look for teachable moments in play when they can help to develop new concepts and ideas. Both year groups use number songs and rhymes regularly and play games involving showing amounts of fingers.
