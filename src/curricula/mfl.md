## Intent

Children at  Decoy Community Primary School’s learn a relevant, broad, vibrant and ambitious foreign languages curriculum that will inspire and excite our pupils using a wide variety of topics and themes. Our aspiration is for all pupils to achieve their full potential by encouraging high expectations and excellent standards in their foreign language learning - the ultimate aim being that pupils will feel excited to, and confident to, continue studying languages beyond Key Stage 2.
