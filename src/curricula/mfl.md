## Intent

Children at  Decoy Community Primary School’s learn a relevant, broad, vibrant and ambitious foreign languages curriculum that will inspire and excite our pupils using a wide variety of topics and themes. Our aspiration is for all pupils to achieve their full potential by encouraging high expectations and excellent standards in their foreign language learning - the ultimate aim being that pupils will feel excited to, and confident to, continue studying languages beyond Key Stage 2.

Our aspiration is that all pupils will develop a genuine interest and positive curiosity about foreign languages, finding them enjoyable and stimulating. Learning a second language will also offer pupils the opportunity to explore relationships between language and identity, develop a deeper understanding of other cultures and the world around them with a better awareness of self, others and cultural differences. The intention is that they will be working towards becoming life-long language learners.

## Implementation

#### Language Angels Scheme of Work

We follow the Language Angels scheme of work for Spanish in Key Stage 2. In our curriculum, there are four key language learning skills; **listening, speaking, reading and writing** are taught and all necessary grammar will be covered in an age-appropriate way across the Our aspiration is that all pupils will develop a genuine interest and positive curiosity about foreign languages, finding them enjoyable and stimulating. Learning a second language will also offer pupils the opportunity to explore relationships between language and identity, develop a deeper understanding of other cultures and the world around them with a better awareness of self, others and cultural differences. This enables pupils to use and apply their learning in a variety of contexts, laying down solid foundations for future language learning. In addition, the children are taught how to research language that they are unsure of and they have a bank of reference materials to help them with their spoken and written tasks going forward. This bank of reference materials develops into a reference library to help pupils recall and build on previous knowledge throughout their primary school language learning journey.
