•	 understand the processes that give rise to key physical and human geographical features of the world, how these are interdependent and how they bring about spatial variation and change over time 

•	are competent in the geographical skills needed to: 

1. collect, analyse and communicate with a range of data gathered through experiences of fieldwork that deepen their understanding of geographical processes 
2. interpret a range of sources of geographical information, including maps, diagrams, globes, aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
