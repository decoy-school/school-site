## Aims

**The national curriculum for geography aims to ensure that all pupils:** 

•	develop contextual knowledge of the location of globally significant places – both terrestrial and marine – including their defining physical and human characteristics and how these provide a geographical context for understanding the actions of processes

•	 understand the processes that give rise to key physical and human geographical features of the world, how these are interdependent and how they bring about spatial variation and change over time 

•	are competent in the geographical skills needed to: 

1. collect, analyse and communicate with a range of data gathered through experiences of fieldwork that deepen their understanding of geographical processes 
2. interpret a range of sources of geographical information, including maps, diagrams, globes, aerial photographs and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) 
3. communicate geographical information in a variety of ways, including through maps, numerical and quantitative skills and writing at length.

### **Geography Intent**

Our Geography curriculum, in line with the National Curriculum, is designed to develop children’s curiosity, fascination and understanding of the world and its people which will remain with them for the rest of their lives.

Our curriculum has the breadth and depth of content to provide high quality geography education. This begins in the early years and builds year on year, developing pupils’ expertise.  Additionally, it builds on knowledge which pupils can draw on for future learning. 

By the end of Key Stage 2, our pupils will *‘Think like a geographer’*

This phrase captures how pupils can learn to

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->build on and expand pupils’ personal experiences of geography and what they already know, thus securing their understanding and helping them commit knowledge to their long-term memory.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->Think about the future

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->Consider how they influence decision that will be made

Furthermore, using real, relevant and contemporary contexts is important in helping pupils relate general principles to actual locations.

Our curriculum will instil in pupils, a sense of being a custodian of the planet and an understanding of how to be world citizens who take action to reduce climate change and the negative impacts this is having on our wonderful world.

### Implementation

Our curriculum is divided into four strands:

*Locational knowledge –* a knowledge of distance, orientation, scale and position (both relatively and using positioning systems (eg longitude and latitude)

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->Knowing ‘where is where’ which supports identity and sense of place

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->Over time, pupils remember this locational knowledge so building up fluency.

*Place knowledge* – is the knowledge which brings meaning to locations and the processes happening there

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->The curriculum and planning builds upon pupils’ prior learning by linking places they already know or are familiar with (here at Decoy this is the area around our school, Newton Abbot and Dartmoor.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->Pupils’ place knowledge is built over time, which allows them to make comparisons.

*Environmental, physical and human geography knowledge* – allow pupils to describe and explain different environments.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->the core understanding is developed first before moving on to more complex phenomena are considered

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->over time pupils learn about processes they are less familiar with or that are less visible.

*Geographical skills and fieldwork* – these skills allow pupils to gather, analyse, present and interpret spatial information.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->Pupils have the skills they need to represent and interpret this information and its repeated practise over time will develop its fluency.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->-       <!--\[endif]-->Fieldwork includes data collection, analysis and presentation. Additionally, it draws together pupils’ locational knowledge and that of human and physical processes and the relationship between them.

Children are inspired to be geographers by taking part in fieldtrips with a clear geographical purpose and experience. There is a comprehensive menu of trips throughout their time at Decoy community Primary School
