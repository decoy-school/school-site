## Intent

Music is intrinsically valuable but supports learning in all other areas of the curriculum.

At Decoy, our intent is to allow children to believe that they are *all* musicians; capable of enjoying music, listening critically, singing, composing, recording and performing in a variety of groups and settings.

From the very beginning of their journey at Decoy, children will make music and begin to learn about notation and other ways of representing music symbolically. Much of our music-making will be cross-curricular and diverse and will include music from around the world; from all genres, historic and present day.

As children progress through the school, they will engage with music with increasing sophistication and have access to recording and music-creation technology, visiting experts, whole class instrumental tuition and off-site visits to listen to and perform music.
