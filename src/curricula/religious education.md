## Aims

**The Devon and Torbay Agreed Syllabus for RE aims to ensure that all pupils:**


**Make sense of a range of religious and non-religious beliefs, so that they can:** 


• identify, describe, explain and analyse beliefs and concepts in the context of living religions, using appropriate vocabulary 


• explain how and why these beliefs are understood in different ways, by individuals and within communities


• recognise how and why sources of authority (e.g. texts, teachings, traditions, leaders) are used, expressed and interpreted in different ways, developing skills of interpretation


**Understand the impact and significance of religious and non-religious beliefs, so that they can:** 


• examine and explain how and why people express their beliefs in diverse ways 


• recognise and account for ways in which people put their beliefs into action in diverse ways, in their everyday lives, within their communities and in the wider world 


• appreciate and appraise the significance of different ways of life and ways of expressing meaning


**Make connections between religious and non-religious beliefs, concepts, practices and ideas studied, so that they can:** 


• evaluate, reflect on and enquire into key concepts and questions studied, responding thoughtfully and creatively, giving good reasons for their responses 


• challenge the ideas studied, and allow the ideas studied to challenge their own thinking, articulating beliefs, values and commitments clearly in response 


• discern possible connections between the ideas studied and their own ways of understanding the world, expressing their critical responses and personal reflections with increasing clarity and understanding
