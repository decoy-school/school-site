The EYFS has three prime areas and four specific areas of learning, each one is fundamental and supports development in all other areas.\
\
The prime areas are:

* Personal, Social and Emotional Development - developing social skills, building self-esteem and confidence, promoting self-care, good behaviour and independence.
* Communication and Language - developing communication skills such as listening and speaking.
* Physical Development - movement, a sense of space, health and bodily awareness, using equipment, tools and materials.

\
The specific areas (through which the three prime areas are strengthened and applied) are:

* Literacy - encouraging children to link sounds and letters and to begin to read and write.
* Mathematics - providing children with opportunities to develop and improve their skills in counting, understanding and using numbers, simple addition and subtraction problems; and to describe shapes, spaces, and measures.
* Understanding the world - involves guiding children to make sense of their physical world and their community through opportunities to explore, observe and find out about people, places, technology and the environment.
* Expressive arts and design involves enabling children to explore and play with a wide range of media and materials, as well as providing opportunities and encouragement for sharing their thoughts, ideas and feelings through a variety of activities in art, music, movement, dance, role-play, and design and technology.
