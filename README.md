# Decoy School

## Static Site Build Project

This repository contains code to build [Decoy Primary School's website](decoyschool.co.uk). It uses [Eleventy](11ty.dev) to build static html/css and [Netlify CMS](netlifycms.org) from content management.

**THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY VERY WIP**

### To Do (not a complete list)

- ~~Finish moving over content~~
- Structure upload folder/media library - fix links to images and pdfs
- Add Netlify CMS script/support/admin page - needs to be done alongside with above, as does putting on github/netlify to get cms to work
- Netlify CMS config
- Styling (basic - this will mostly be inline)
- Check policies etc against current site - what needs to be updated?
- Photos - take new photos, check permissions
